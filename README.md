# vueJsProjects
# first crud app 
I am pretty proud of this one, I was originally watching a tutorial on youtube but then decided it would be more fun to just try and figure it out myself. Of course I didn't know how to integrate App.vue but I simply imported vue with the cdn and it worked reasonably well. It is a bit annoying to have component templates in strings but I am nonetheless very happy with this application. I learned a lot over the few hours trying to implement this simple crud app myself.
